# Analysis of the Snapchat Political Ads Library

## Project Purpose 

I will be looking at the Snapchat Political Ads Library which Snapchat has made publicly available since 2018.I will specifically be looking at what political organizations use Snapchat the most for advertising, which ads make the most impressions, targeted age/geographic groups, and what kinds of ads were more prevalent in 2020 around election time.

Political ads on social media have always been pretty controversial. Facebook has refused to fact check their political ads and after much hate they finally decided in early November to ban political ads all together. Twitter on the other hand banned political ads pretty early on back in 2019. I thought that taking a look at Snapchat's political ads would be particularly interesting because Snapchat claims to fact check all of their political ads and in the recent election it is said that they were actively going after political advertising rather than stepping away from it like Facebook and Twitter have.

## Data Source 

The data that I will be using comes directly from the Snapchat website: https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/.

Snapchat regards an ad as 'political' if it is election, advocacy, or issue related.

Some information on the column names that will be beneficial to know (see here for full list):

Currency Code - local currency used to pay for advertisement
Spend - amount (in local currency) spent on advertisement
Impressions - number of times the ad has been viewed
Organization Name - organization responsible for creating the Ad
CandidateBallotInformation - candidate/ ballot initiative associated with the Ad
PayingAdvertiserName - entity providing the funds for the Ad
GenderCode - targeted gender
AgeBracket - target age group
Interests - interests of targeted audience
Advanced Demographics - 3rd party data segments targeting criteria used in Ad
